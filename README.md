## INSTALLATION & GUIS [:arrow_up:](#index)
With platform specific installers for Git, GitHub also provides the ease of staying up-to-date with the latest releases of the command line tool while providing a graphical user interface for day-to-day interaction, review, and repository synchronization.

#### GitHub for Windows

<h>
For Linux and Solaris platforms, the latest release is available on the official Git web site.

## SETUP [:arrow_up:](#index)
Configuring user information used across all local repositories

```bash
# set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history
git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”
```

```bash
# set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”
```

```bash
# set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
git config --global color.ui auto
```


## SETUP & INIT [:arrow_up:](#index)
Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories

```bash
# initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
git init
```

```bash
# retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
git clone [url]
```


## STAGE & SNAPSHOT [:arrow_up:](#index)
Working with snapshots and the Git staging area

```bash
# show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
git status
```

```bash
# add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
git add [file]
```

```bash
# unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
git reset [file]
```

```bash
# diff of what is changed but not staged
git diff
```

```bash
# diff of what is staged but not yet committed
git diff --staged
```

```bash
# commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot
git commit -m “[descriptive message]”
```


## BRANCH & MERGE [:arrow_up:](#index)
Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

```bash
# list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
git branch
```

```bash
# create a new branch at the current commit
git branch [branch-name]
```

```bash
# switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
git checkout
```

```bash
# merge the specified branch’s history into the current one
git merge [branch]
```

```bash
# show all commits in the current branch’s history
git log
```


## INSPECT & COMPARE [:arrow_up:](#index)
Examining logs, diffs and object information

```bash
# show the commit history for the currently active branch
git log
```

```bash
# show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB
git log branchB..branchA
```

```bash
# show the commits that changed file, even across renames
git log --follow [file]
```

```bash
# show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB
git diff branchB...branchA
```

```bash
# show any object in Git in human-readable format
git show [SHA]
```


## TRACKING PATH CHANGES [:arrow_up:](#index)
Versioning file removes and path changes

```bash
# delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit
git rm [file]
```

```bash
# change an existing file path and stage the move
git mv [existing-path] [new-path]
```

```bash
# show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved
git log --stat -M
```


## IGNORING PATTERNS [:arrow_up:](#index)
Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files
```
logs/
*.notes
pattern*/
```
Save a file with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string
matches or wildcard globs.

```bash
# system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
```


## SHARE & UPDATE [:arrow_up:](#index)
Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

```bash
# add a git URL as an alias
git remote add [alias] [url]
```

```bash
# fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
git fetch [alias]
```

```bash
# merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
git merge [alias]/[branch]
```

```bash
# Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
git push [alias] [branch]
```

```bash
# fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
git pull
```


## REWRITE HISTORY [:arrow_up:](#index)
Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history

```bash
# apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one
git rebase [branch]
```

```bash
# clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit
git reset --hard [commit]
```


## TEMPORARY COMMITS [:arrow_up:](#index)
Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches

```bash
# Save modified and staged changes
git stash
```

```bash
# list stack-order of stashed file changes
git stash list
```

```bash
# write working from top of stash stack
git stash pop
```

```bash
# discard the changes from top of stash stack
git stash drop
```
